# Training Models with Deepcell-tf

Hardware acceleration has played a critical role in deep learning's rise to prominence. While DeepCell can be used on conventional hardware, acceleration with GPUs certainly extends its capabilities. Google has provided free and easy access to accelerated environments with Colaboratory. Google Colaboratory (or Colab for short) is essentially a jupyter notebook hosted by Google cloud machines.

An example DeepCell training notebook is available here: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vanvalenlab/intro-to-deepcell/blob/Janelia_Reorg/model_training/training_with_deepcell-tf.ipynb){:target="_blank"}
