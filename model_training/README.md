## Introduction to deepcell-tf

[`deepcell-tf`](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-tf) is a TensorFlow-based deep learning library for biological images.
It provides several resources for training and evaluating deep learning models including:

* Downloadable datasets (`deepcell.datasets`)
* Image data generators (`deepcell.image_generators`)
* Predefined model architectures (`deepcell.model_zoo`)
* Evaluation metrics (`deepcell.metrics`)
* Pre-trained models (`deepcell.applications`)

## Model training with Google Colab

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) provides free and easy access to GPU environments. Click the badge below to open a DeepCell training notebook and train your own model.
