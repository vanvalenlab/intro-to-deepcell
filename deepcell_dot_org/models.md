## Model types
The DeepCell server has three distinct model types, each with their own requirements for how data should be formatted

* [Multiplex Model](models.md#multiplex-model)
* [Nuclear Segmentation Model](models.md#nuclear-segmentation-model)
* [Tracking Model](models.md#tracking-model)

## Multiplex Model
The multiplex model performs whole-cell segmentation of tissue imaging data. The input to the model is two-channel images. The first channel must be a
nuclear channel (such as DAPI). The second channel must be a membrane or cytoplasmic channel (such as E-Cadherin). 

## Nuclear Segmentation Model
TODO: do we describe both nuclear and cytoplasm model? Only one? Keep this blank?

## Tracking Model
TODO: do we describe the tracking model?
