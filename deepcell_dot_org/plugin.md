## ImageJ Plugin
The ImageJ plugin provides an easy interface to access our pretrained deep learning models within ImageJ itself. Data is automatically uploaded to our server,
processed, and then returned within ImageJ. 

Before getting started, make sure you understand [the available models and data formatting requirements](models.md)
