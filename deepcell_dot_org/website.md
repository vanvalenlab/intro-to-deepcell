## Introduction to DeepCell.org
Deepcell.org is a web-based interface to access our pretrained deep learning models. The website allows you to easily upload example images, 
run them on our available models, and download the results without requiring any local installation. 


## Scalable cloud backend for efficient deployment of deep learning models
DeepCell.org is run by the [DeepCell Kiosk](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/kiosk-console). The Kiosk provides an effecient and scalable way to analyze 
large volumes of data using cloud computing. By automatically scaling up when useage increases and scaling down when useage decreases, the Kiosk
is able to quickly deliver results for large numbers of images when demand increases, while reducing costs by downscaling when demand decreases.
